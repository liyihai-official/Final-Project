# Final-Project

<!-- ![Animated GIF](Heat3D/Heat_3D.gif) -->
This is the final project of M.Sc in High Performance Computing program.
Currently, research is focusing on finding numerical solutions of Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs), including heat equations.

### Report Note

- Two main reasons for using meta-programming techniques:
    - Improved type safety
    - Improved run-time performance

#### Jun, 18- Jul, 8 2024
- Working Path : ```MPI.Heat/C++Heat/ver5.0``` and ```PINN/```

- Got a local CUDA accelerate supported PC (Jun, 18-30)
    - Install ```Libtorch``` on ```Linux - Ubuntu 22.04```, with CUDA 12.x suported RTX 4070 .
    - MPI/OpenMP programming setup.
    - Learning how to use ```Libtorch``` in C++


- Hybrid programming of MPI/SMP (Jun, 25 - Jul. 8)
Hybrid programming is a reasonable idea of parallel programming which specifically optimized for each cluster hardware structure.
    - Version 4.0 and 5.0 is a Completely rewrite program of version 3.0
        - Add ```CMakeLists``` file to make build process smother, also it is required for ```Libtorch``` compiling.
        - Add visibility attributes for improving safety of programs.
        - The ```multiarray``` objects are rebuilt with template arguments of dimensions (1, 2, 3).
    
    - Version 5.0
        - Add various exchange and evolving strategies on grids.
            - [x] ping-pong evolving strategies
            - [ ] even-odd strategies

\section{Introduction}
Numerical methods of solving partial differential equations (PDE) have 
demonstrate far better performance than many other methods such as finite 
difference methods (FDM) \cite{},
finite element methods (FEM) \cite{}, 
Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) \cite{}
and Monte Carlo Method (MC) \cite{}.
In recent years, researchers in the field of deep learning have mainly focused 
on how to develop more powerful system architectures and learning methods such 
as convolution neural networks (CNNs) \cite{}, 
Transformers \cite{} 
and Perceivers \cite{} .
In addition, more researchers have tried to develop more powerful models specifically 
for numerical simulations. 
Despite of the relentless progress, modeling and predicting the evolution of nonlinear 
multiscale systems which has inhomogeneous cascades-scales by using classical analytical 
or computational tools inevitably encounts severe challanges and comes with prohibitive
cost and multiple sources of uncertainty.
This project focuses the benefits of the parallalization on appriximating nonliner systems.
In general, the FDM and FEM methods are evaluated on pure message passing interface (MPI) \cite{MPI}
parallelizations.
Moreover, it also prompted Hybrid parallel strategies on FDM which combined MPI and share memory 
parallalization \cite{SMP}
(SMP) to make more use of the speed promotions come from faster caches of each compute unit. 
Besides the Hybrid strategies on FDM, the FEM is built on the external library Deal.II \cite{DEAL.II},
which also built on MPI parallalizations. (BUT CURRENTLY NOT SURE for Hybrid).

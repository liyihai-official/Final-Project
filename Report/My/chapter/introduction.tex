\section{Introduction}
Numerical methods of solving partial differential equations (PDE) have 
demonstrate far better performance than many other methods such as finite 
difference methods (FDM) \cite{},
finite element methods (FEM) \cite{}, 
Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) \cite{}
and Monte Carlo Method (MC) \cite{}.
In recent years, researchers in the field of deep learning have mainly focused 
on how to develop more powerful system architectures and learning methods such 
as convolution neural networks (CNNs) \cite{}, 
Transformers \cite{} 
and Perceivers \cite{} .
In addition, more researchers have tried to develop more powerful models specifically 
for numerical simulations. 
Despite of the relentless progress, modeling and predicting the evolution of nonlinear 
multiscale systems which has inhomogeneous cascades-scales by using classical analytical 
or computational tools inevitably encounts severe challanges and comes with prohibitive
cost and multiple sources of uncertainty.

This project focuses on the promotions on performance gained from the parallel compute systems, 
in general, the FDMs and Neural Networks (NNs) are evaluated.
Moreover, it prompted series Message Passing and Shared Memory hybrid parallel strategies using 
Message Passing Interface (MPI) \cite{MPI}
and
Open Multi-processing (OpenMP) \cite{OpenMP}.
